# HR Attrition Dashboard

## Problem Statement:
Employee attrition is a key concern for HR departments as it impacts productivity, team dynamics, and costs associated with hiring and training. Understanding the factors behind employee attrition can help HR teams develop effective retention strategies and improve overall workforce satisfaction. This project aims to analyze employee data to identify patterns and insights related to attrition, such as demographics, job roles, work-life balance, and more.

## Metrics Defined

The following key metrics were defined to understand and analyze employee attrition:

## Demographics

**Gender:** Gender-based segmentation of the workforce.

**Distance from Home:** Grouped into categories (e.g., Near, Far, Very Far) to analyze commuting impact.

**Marital Status:** Distribution across categories (Single, Married, Divorced) to see if personal life factors correlate with attrition.

## Turnover Analysis 1:

**Department**: Attrition across different departments to identify specific areas affected.

**Job Role:** Analysis of attrition based on job roles and positions.

**Business Travel Impact:** Examining if frequent business travel affects attrition.

**Tenure:** Insights into how years in the current role correlate with attrition rates.

**Overtime & Performance Ratings:** Correlation of overtime hours and performance ratings with attrition.

**Monthly Income:** Income levels and their effect on attrition rates.

**Attrition Increase Levels:** Patterns showing where attrition is increasing.

## Turnover Analysis 3:

A deeper view of employee data focused on identifying specific segments with higher attrition, aiding in targeted HR strategies.
